# Kasper Music Player

---

Why Kasper? <br>
As It is the name of my dog and it rhymes with the iconic app Napster.

It is a music streaming app which allows free music streaming for all and bypasses the youtube music algorithm to work even in restricted countries.

## History

[(Back to contents👆🏻)](#contents)

<p> This project started as a custom media server created using flask and vlc to allow youtube streaming via terminal in search of creating a server. Even worked on less powerful devices like RaspberryPi.</p>

## RoadMap

[(Back to contents👆🏻)](#contents)

UI Refactor(Including Audio Player) -> Add Travis -> Connect a DataBase(FireBase, until a better option available) -> Add API for PlayLists -> Likes -> Support For Different Platforms

## Installation

[(Back to contents👆🏻)](#contents)

### To start the Flask Server

- It is advised to use a `pipenv` as the already installed versions of vlc might interfere with the ones in the dependencies

- Use the command `pip3 install pipenv`

- Now go into server directory using the command `cd server/`

- Next, install the dependenices by using the command `pipenv install`

- Before running the server, get your YouTube API key by following this guide - https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

- To run the server, use the command `pipenv run python3 server.py`

### To start the React Frontend

- Open terminal to get started.

- To clone the repo, type `git clone https://github.com/sansyrox/kasper_music_player.git` in your terminal.

- Then go to the frontend directory using `cd kasper_music_player/youtube_mp3_frontend`.

- Install the dependencies using `npm install --save`

- Install tachyons using `npm install tachyons`

- Install react-coverflow using `npm install react-coverflow`

- To start the react app, Use `npm start`.

- Now the app would have started on your default browser!!
