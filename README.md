## History
[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)
<p> This project started as a custom media server created using flask and vlc to allow youtube streaming via terminal in search of creating a server even worked on less powerful devices like RaspberryPi.</p>

## RoadMap
[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)
<p> Currently as for initial Stage, I expect to make a "music.youtube.com" like app that works in India too and plays only mp3 music incorporating Youtube Suggestion too using Youtube API's or scrapping if required. </p>
<p> As of now, the front-end and backend will be in a common repo and would be separated if the app shows some promise. </p>
